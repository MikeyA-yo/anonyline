# üõ°Ô∏è Community Code of Conduct

In our community, we uphold traditional values and expect all members to conduct themselves with respect and decency. Behaviors that contribute positively include showing kindness to others, respecting differing opinions, accepting constructive feedback gracefully, taking responsibility for one's actions, and prioritizing the well-being of the community.

Unacceptable behaviors include the use of inappropriate language or imagery, engaging in trolling or personal attacks, harassment in any form, and sharing others' private information without consent.

Community leaders are responsible for enforcing these standards and have the authority to address any behavior deemed inappropriate. This may involve removing or editing contributions that violate our code of conduct and communicating the reasons for such actions when appropriate. This code applies to all community spaces and to individuals representing the community in public forums.
